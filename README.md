# One_Steam_Vim_Theme
This is a vim theme inspired by the v1 of the steam game client


Make sure you have this added to your `.vimrc` for the true colors of the theme.
```vim
if has('termguicolors')
  set termguicolors
endif
```

## Installation
1 Add the One_Steam_Vim_Theme.vim file to your `~/.vim/colors` directory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 If the directory does not exist then create one

2 Add this line into your `.vimrc`
```vim
colorscheme One_Steam_Vim_Theme
```

3 Finally do a good old `:source %` while in the vim editor.
